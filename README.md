Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the use engineering fetures to analyse design develop test and maintain softwares
its importances include:
it makes it more secure through encription, security checks and prevents cyber threats
it makes it scalable and more reliable for future use and growth
through the processes involved, it reduces mistakes made in the latter process of the making of the software 
it is less costly as through the analysis and design process one can check on the best and less costly requirements and also avoid costly mistakes
it breaks down complex softwares into managable tasks making it easy to handle
it ensures that the final product is secure,reliable and efficient


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of software development:
it made software development more organised
waterfall model:
it created step by step processes to be followed hrough software development
agile:
it introduced flexible and itelative development promoting adaptility, customer collabolation and smaller functional software increments




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planing. get the objectives of the project
analysis. understsnding user needs 
design.  create a blue print of the document
implementation.  code the design 
testing.  ensure the software works as expected and debug the code
deployment.  release the software to the users
maintenance.  make sure the software is always running smoothly



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall has step by step processes while agile has cycles
waterfall is less flexible compared to agile when changing plans
waterfall only involves user at the end while agile invoves user in each cycle
in waterfall, testing happens at the end in the testing phase while in agile testing happens on every phase

both processes are for creating softwares
both include stages
both methods document their projects the same way

waterfall can be best used when building a hospital management system because every requirement must be carefully defined and tested before release
agile can be best used in developing a social media app where features can evolve as users give feedback 



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer:
writing codes,implementing features,debugging and troubleshooting,code reviews and documentation
quality assuarance engineer:
creating test plans to check if features work as expected
test software by hand
check if software is fast and reliable
project manager:
decides project milestones
cralifies client needs
acts as main contact between stakeholders and the whole team
ensures the team works together smoothly



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs allow writting testing and debugging code easier so you dont have to waste time switching between tools eg. visual studio code
VCS ensure code is safe, organised and easy to collaborate on eg. Git



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
dealing with complex codebases which are hard to manage. this can be overcome by usin VCS like git to track changes in he code and also use comments in the code to explain each block of code
Bugs. this can be fixed by laveraging IDEs with built in debuggers
Keep up with technologies. this is fixed by continuing to learn


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of a code it helps catch small bugs early
Integration testing ensures ombined components interact correctly.it helps to catch issues with how componens interacts
System testing is testing the entire complete system.it helps to validate end to end functionality
Acceptance testing is testing if the software meets business requireents and is ready for release . it ensures the product is ready for production


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is making a precise input to the AI in order to get the required output
its importance include:
Getting accurate responces from the AI
Save time and effort
Customize output
Get accurate responces

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt:  tell me about software development
improved prompt:  Explain the software development process, including key phases like planning, design, coding, testing, and deployment, in simple terms for a beginner
this is better because:
Specific Topic: Focuses on the software development process (not just development in general).
Clear Structure: Mentions specific phases to cover, guiding the AIâ€™s response.
Audience Defined: Specifies the explanation should be simple for a beginner, influencing the tone and detail level.
